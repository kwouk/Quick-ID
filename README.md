Quick ID is an Alfred Workflow that generates (probably) unique IDs for notes, text files, etc. This isn't meant to be used for anything related to security. I created this for my own use, so it hasn't been tested much.

You can use this either as a snippet (if enabled in Alfred) or as a standard keyword.

The 'hash' keyword generates a sha224 hash based on system time.

The 'timestamp' option generates a timestamp to the second.

## Installation

Just download the file, then double-click it to install it in Alfred. To use the `\\hash` or `\\timestamp` snippets, the **Automatically expand snippets by keyword** option needs to be enabled in settings. The standard keyword-based uses should be available by default.

Using this workflow requires the Alfred Powerpack.
